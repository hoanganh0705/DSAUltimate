// Binary Search Implementation in Go
//
// Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
// It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item,
// until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.
//
// Time Complexity: O(log n)
// Space Complexity: O(1)
//
// Example:
// Input: sorted array = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], target = 5
// Output: 2 (index of 5)
//
// Input: sorted array = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], target = 6
// Output: -1 (not found)
